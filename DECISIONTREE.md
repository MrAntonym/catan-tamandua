The English text version of the decision tree for the bot.

# Reused Constants and Math
The following are constants which are used throughout the document and their values:
>x = 1/36

The following is some math and probabilities that are assumed to be known offhand:
>Probability of two dice rolling a:
>2 ⟹1/36
>3 ⟹ 2

# Start of the game
If the bot is the picking settlement placement last then go to [Double settlement](#double-settlement). Otherwise, go to [First settlement](#first-settlement).

# First settlement
For each available vertex (those not too close to other settlements), add the probability of each of the hexes' numbers being rolled.
