# DECISIONTREE
The English text version of the decision tree for the bot.

# Start of the game
If the bot is the picking settlement placement last then go to [Double settlement](#double-settlement). Otherwise, go to [First settlement](#first-settlement).

# First settlement
For each available vertex (those not too close to other settlements), add the probability of each of the hexes' numbers being rolled.
