# catan-tamandua
A bot based on a fixed decision tree which implements scalars determined by genetic machine learning to play the board game [Settlers of Catan](https://www.catan.com).

# Installing
Currently, there is nothing to install as the decision tree is still being hashed out; see [DECISIONTREE.md](https://github.com/MrAntonym/catan-tamandua/blob/master/DECISIONTREE.md).
